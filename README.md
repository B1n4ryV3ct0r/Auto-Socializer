# Socializing Replacement
Anti-Social  Dialogue Generator

This project exists so I don't have to be social — despite *some* people's best efforts to make it otherwise.
It’s essentially an NPC-style dialogue generator that spits out canned responses for greetings, goodbyes, remarks, and small talk — perfect for avoiding real human interaction while still seeming *technically* polite.
Whether you're building a game, an oddly extroverted yet shallow chatbot, or just trying to get through the day with minimal human interaction, this generator is here to help!

**Features**

  Random small talk lines and canned remarks
  NPC-style interactions for human-facing scenarios
  Makes you appear social without being soical
  Designed for maximum avoidance of real conversation
  Helps you avoid unnecessary human interaction

**Use Cases**

  Building NPCs for games
  Feeding lines to chatbots
  Auto-generating polite (but distant) responses
  Human interaction buffer
  Pretending to be engaged in conversation while actually doing something better (or literally anything else tbh) 
  When you're being forced to be social but your social battery is dead

**Why did i make this?**

  Because sometimes, being social is suboptional — and automation is beautiful.

**Status**

  This is a personal tool, but feel free to fork, contribute, or expand it into something more elaborate (or more antisocial). 
  Just please give me access so I can keep being antisocial myself.
