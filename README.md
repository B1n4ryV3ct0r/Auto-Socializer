# Socializing Replacement
Anti-Social Socializer/Dialogue Generator

This project exists so I don't have to be social — despite *some* people's best efforts to make it otherwise.
It’s essentially an NPC-style dialogue generator that spits out canned responses for greetings, goodbyes, remarks, and small talk — perfect for avoiding real human interaction while still seeming technically polite.

Now with interactive console input, you can choose the tone and type of dialogue you want, tailoring your generated responses to fit any situation or mood so you don't have to interpert those pesky social cues yourself! Whether you're building a game, an oddly extroverted yet shallow chatbot, or just trying to get through the day with minimal human interaction, this generator is here to help!


**Features**

 
  Random small talk lines, greetings, remarks, and goodbyes

  Multiple selectable tones: Friendly, Sarcastic, and Formal

  Interactive console interface to choose tone and dialogue type on the fly

  NPC-style interactions for human-facing scenarios

  Makes you appear social without actually being social

  Designed for maximum avoidance of real conversation

  Helps you dodge unnecessary human interaction with style


**Use Cases**

  
  Building annoyingly shallow NPCs for games 

  Auto-generating polite (but distant) responses tailored to your mood

  Acting as a buffer for human interaction

  Pretending to be engaged in conversation while doing literally anything else

  When you’re forced to socialize but your social battery is dead

  When you're just done with everything, including other people


**Why Did I Make This?**
  
  
  Because sometimes, being social is *suboptional* — and automation is beautiful.


**Status**

  
  This is a personal tool, but feel free to fork, contribute, or expand it into something more elaborate (or more antisocial).

  Just please give me access or make a pull request so I can keep being antisocial myself.


Yours in solitude,
