# Socializing Replacement
Anti-Social Socializer/Dialogue Generator

This project exists so I don't have to be social — despite *some* people's best efforts to make it otherwise.
It’s essentially an NPC-style dialogue generator that spits out canned responses for greetings, goodbyes, remarks, and small talk — perfect for avoiding real human interaction while still seeming *technically* polite.

Now with interactive console input, you can choose the tone and type of dialogue you want, tailoring your generated responses to fit any situation or mood so you don't have to interpert those pesky social cues yourself! Whether you're building a game, an oddly extroverted yet shallow chatbot, or just trying to get through the day with minimal human interaction, this generator is here to help!



**Features**

 
   - Random small talk lines, greetings, remarks, and goodbyes

   - Multiple selectable tones: Friendly, Sarcastic, and Formal

   - Interactive console interface to choose tone and dialogue type on the fly

   - NPC-style interactions for human-facing scenarios

   - Makes you appear social without actually being social

   - Designed for maximum avoidance of real conversation

   - Helps you dodge unnecessary human interaction with style
     



**Use Cases**

  
  - Building annoyingly shallow NPCs for games 

  - Auto-generating polite (but distant) responses tailored to your mood

  - Acting as a buffer for human interaction

  - Pretending to be engaged in conversation while doing literally anything else

  - When you’re forced to socialize but your social battery is dead

  - When you're just done with everything, including other people



**Why Did I Make This?**
  
  
  Because sometimes, being social is *suboptional* — and automation is beautiful.



**Status**

  
  This is a personal tool, but feel free to fork, contribute, or expand it into something more elaborate (or more antisocial).

  Just please give me access or make a pull request so I can keep being antisocial myself.


Yours in solitude,

## Update — Expanded Tones & Dialogue Types

**v.who.even.cares**

 The same trusted Auto-Socializer you know and love — now with even more flavor, depth, and options to suit your people avoiding needs!


### What’s New?

- **More Tones Added!**  
  Beyond Friendly, Sarcastic, and Formal, you can now choose from the new options such as **Cheerful**, **Melancholic**, and even more to match the vibe of the conversation you do
  *not* want to be a part of.

- **Expanded Dialogue Types!**  
  The repertoire has grown beyond greetings, chitchat, and goodbyes to include:  
  **Compliments**, **Questions**, **Advice**, **Stories**, and **Observations** and more — covering all your conversational bases so you dont have to!


### Why does this matter?

Because avoiding people gracefully requires variety and nuance — now you can sound friendly, sarcastic, formal, cheerful, or melancholic, depending on the audience or your mood, without actually talking to anyone. Win-win. And because I have to meet a new person today so I need all my bases covered.


### How to Use

Just run the program as usual. The new tone option(s) and dialogue type(s) will be right there waiting for you in the menus. Pick what tone fits the conversation you want to 
avoid, and let the Auto-Socializer do the rest!


- **Friendly**: The go-to warm and approachable vibe without any of that pesky warmth on your part! 
- **Sarcastic**: Perfect for passive-aggressive politeness. Or just passive-agressiveness. Or just agressiveness. We're not picky.
- **Formal**: When you want to sound dignified but distant, or so hauty and unapproachable that people automatically leave you alone
- **Cheerful**: Brighten conversations without effort or sincerety  
- **Melancholic**: For when the mood’s more thoughtful or downbeat, when you're depressed and want to drag others down with you, or when you want to say somehting thats guarenteed
   to get people to ask "are you ok?" (which you can answer with help of the Auto-socializer's yes/no choice for generating more socialization!)

Stay antisocial,

## Emergency Update — Gracious Professionalism 

**v.gracious.overload**

Because sometimes, being polite is not enough — you need to radiate positivity with the force of a thousand suns!


### What’s New?

- **Gracious Professionalism Tone Added!**
 Introducing a brand new, outrageously enthusiastic and over-the-top tone designed to deliver dialogue dripping with kindness, motivation, and legendary team spirit. Perfect for  
 sounding like the most inspiring person in the room while dodging actual conversation.

- **Introduction Dialogue Option Added!**
 Now you can kick off any interaction with a powerful, polished introduction that sets the tone for your social escape. Whether you want to dazzle, charm, inspire, or piss off,
 the introduction dialogue option has you covered.


### Why does this matter?

Because social interactions don’t just start with a greeting — sometimes you need to make a grand entrance. The Gracious Professionalism tone brings new energy to your automated 
responses, helping you stand out as the ultimate social avoidance guru who’s still impossibly kind and motivating, to the point of being sickening! (and because Michael told me I 
needed to be more Graciously Professional because apparently wearing apriltag-covered clothing to competitions to sabatoge other team's robots is not, in fact, Graciously 
Professional)


### How to Use

As always, just run the program as usual. The new tone option(s) and dialogue type(s) will be right there waiting for you in the menus. Pick what tone fits the conversation you 
want to avoid, and let the Auto-Socializer do the rest!

Stay antisocial (but like, super nice about it),
